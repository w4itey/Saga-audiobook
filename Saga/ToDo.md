## ToDo
1. create a library view
   - I want three rows
		* the First row will be a "Continue Reading" row we will use this api endpoint to retrieve these books https://api.audiobookshelf.org/#get-library-items-in-progress
		* Row Two will be an "Up Next" Row where we will pull all of a users completed books, and find the next unread book in a series. Will need to research the best way to do this https://api.audiobookshelf.org
	 	* Row three will be a newly added which will display the latest books added to the server 	https://api.audiobookshelf.org/#get-library-items-in-progress
	- Each Row should display the name of the book below the Albumn art for the book.
	- I should be able to click on each book to open that book up, see its albumn art, the Name, Series Name and Number in Series, The Description, Have the option to play, read the ebook, or download the book locally.
